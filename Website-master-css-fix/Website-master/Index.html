								Richard Matthew Stallman (born March 16, 1953), often known by his initials, RMS, is an American software freedom activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License.

                    When looking at the difference between Unix and Unix-like operating systems, it’s hard to tell that there even is one at first glance. There are many, many things that the two groups have in common (which might not be very surprising due to the groups’ names). But there are little differences here and there, depending on which exact version of the Unix and Unix-like operating systems you’re comparing. Various services have slightly different locations (such as startup scripts), they often have different designs to offer the same functionality, and they may include the entire system or just the kernel.

                    However, it’s important to realize that new software is almost always developed for Linux first and later ported to Unix (excluding Mac OS X). A lot of tools which were first made for Linux systems, such as the Gnome and KDE desktop environments, can now be installed on Unix and other Unix-like systems. It’s also important to note that Linux (and most other Unix-like operating systems) are free to obtain and use, while Unix operating systems are not.
