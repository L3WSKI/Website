Put your names + date of change

Jack - 15/11/2016: 
Fixed the website, changed the appearance, made everything work (almost) and generally cleaned everything up.
Validated every webpage so no errors occur on W3Schools. 

To continue - work through Threshold tasks so that the website passes them all.
